The skill is installed in `{skill_path}/`

No additional dependencies required for basic usage.

## Usage

### In GLM

Simply invoke the skill:

```

### Direct CLI Usage

```bash
# Standard research
python {skill_path}/scripts/research_engine.py --query "Your research question" --mode standard

# Deep research (all 8 phases)
python {skill_path}/scripts/research_engine.py --query "Your research question" --mode deep

# Quick research (3 phases only)
python {skill_path}/scripts/research_engine.py --query "Your research question" --mode quick

# Ultra-deep research (extended iterations)

## Output

Research reports are saved to organized folders in `{project_path}/Documents/[Topic]_Research_[Date]/`

Each report includes:
- Executive Summary
- Detailed Analysis with Citations
- Synthesis & Insights
- Limitations & Caveats
- Recommendations
- Full Bibliography
- Methodology Appendix

### Unlimited Report Generation (2025 Auto-Continuation System)

Reports use **progressive file assembly with auto-continuation** - achieving truly unlimited length through recursive agent spawning:

**How It Works:**

1. **Initial Generation (18K words)**
   - Generate sections 1-10 progressively
   - Each section written to file immediately (stays under 32K limit per agent)
   - Save continuation state with research context

2. **Auto-Continuation (if needed)**
   - Automatically spawns continuation agent via Task tool
   - Continuation agent loads state: themes, narrative arc, citations, quality metrics
   - Generates next batch of sections (another 18K words)
   - Updates state and spawns next agent if more sections remain

3. **Recursive Chaining**
   - Each agent stays under 32K output token limit
   - Chain continues until all sections complete
   - Final agent generates bibliography and validates report

**Realistic Report Sizes:**
- **Quick mode**: 2,000-4,000 words (single run) ✅
- **Standard mode**: 4,000-8,000 words (single run) ✅
- **Deep mode**: 8,000-15,000 words (single run) ✅
- **UltraDeep mode**: 20,000-100,000+ words (auto-continuation) ✅

**Example: 50,000 word report:**
- Agent 1: Sections 1-10 (18K words) → Spawns Agent 2
- Agent 2: Sections 11-20 (18K words) → Spawns Agent 3
- Agent 3: Sections 21-25 + Bibliography (14K words) → Complete!
- Total: 50K words across 3 agents, each under 32K limit

**Context Preservation (Quality Safeguards):**

Continuation state includes:
- ✅ Research question and key themes
- ✅ Main findings summaries (100 words each)
- ✅ Narrative arc position (beginning/middle/end)
- ✅ Quality metrics (avg words, citation density, prose ratio)
- ✅ All citations used + bibliography entries
- ✅ Writing style characteristics

Each continuation agent:
- Reads last 3 sections to understand flow
- Maintains established themes and style
- Continues citation numbering correctly
- Matches quality metrics (±20% tolerance)
- Verifies coherence before each section

**Quality Gates (Per Section):**
- [ ] Word count: Within ±20% of average
- [ ] Citation density: Matches established rate
- [ ] Prose ratio: ≥80% prose (not bullets)
- [ ] Theme alignment: Ties to key themes
- [ ] Style consistency: Matches established patterns

**Benefits:**
- ✅ TRUE unlimited length (50K, 100K+ words achievable)
- ✅ Fully automatic (no manual intervention)
- ✅ Context preserved across continuations
- ✅ Quality maintained throughout
- ✅ Each agent stays under 32K token limit
- ✅ Progressive assembly prevents truncation

## Examples

```

### Scientific Review
```

```

## Quality Standards

Every research output:
- ✅ Minimum 10+ distinct sources
- ✅ Citations for all major claims
- ✅ Cross-verified facts (3+ sources)
- ✅ Executive summary under 250 words
- ✅ Limitations section
- ✅ Full bibliography
- ✅ Methodology documentation

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Frame questions clearly with context
2. **Set Expectations**: Specify if you need comparisons, recommendations, or pure analysis
3. **Choose Appropriate Mode**: Use Quick for exploration, Deep for decisions
4. **Review Scope**: Check Phase 1 output to ensure research is on track
5. **Leverage Citations**: Use citation numbers to drill deeper into specific sources
